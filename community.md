The Envoy development process is an open process. Here are the general communication channels we use to communicate.

## Mailing lists

* [envoy-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-announce): Low frequency mailing list where we will email announcements only.
* [envoy-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-users): General user discussion.
* [envoy-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/envoy-dev): Envoy developer discussion (APIs, feature design, etc.).

Please see [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/envoy-announce/l9zjYsnS3TY) email thread for information on email list usage.

## Chat

* [lyft/envoy](https://gitter.im/lyft/envoy): Gitter (most people use Gitter. NOTE: Response to user questions is best effort on Gitter. For a "guaranteed" response please email envoy-users@ per the guidance in the following linked thread)
* [#lyft-envoy](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=lyft-envoy): IRC (synced to Gitter)

## Other

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EnvoyProxy/): Follow along on Twitter!
* [GitHub](https://github.com/envoyproxy/)


## Reporting security vulnerabilities

If you've found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in Envoy please let us know at security@lyft.com. We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.
