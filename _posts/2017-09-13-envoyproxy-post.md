Welcome to the new home of Envoy, envoyproxy.io. With our move to the CNCF we thought it 
was a good time for a website refresh. This new version was graciously developed by the 
folks over at [datawire.io](https://www.datawire.io/). Thank you! It's been redesigned to 
focus on the growing Envoy community and make it easier for us to disseminate information 
via a built-in blog. Look for small changes over the next couple of weeks as we finish our 
migration from Lyft owned accounts to dedicated Envoy proxy accounts. If there are additional 
things you would like to see here in the future please 
[contact us](https://envoyproxy.github.io/community) and let us know!
